# **Movie-Recommendation-System**

## Introduction:
This repository contains the code and documentation for **my capstone project**, the Movie Recommendation Project. This project was developed as part of the **"Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals"** specialization offered by Duke University on [Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-recommender)

## Poject Demo:
You can experience the Movie Recommendation Project by running it [HERE.](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//capstone/recommender.php?id=B37WQb4kuPaV8D)
>The user interface for this project is provided by Duke University, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Project Overview:
The main objective of this project is to provide personalized movie recommendations based on the similarity of ratings given by the user and professional raters on IMDb. By analyzing the user's rating patterns, we can identify raters who share similar tastes and preferences. The recommended movies are those highly regarded by these similar raters.

<b>Project Steps:</b>

1.Data Processing:

 The project reads and parses movie and rating data, organizing them into lists and maps for efficient processing.
   
2.Average Ratings Calculation:

The average ratings for movies are calculated, providing a baseline for comparison.

3.Similarity Calculation:

The project determines how similar a given rater is to another user by comparing their rating patterns.

4.Movie Recommendation:

Based on the calculated similarity, the project recommends movies to the user that are highly regarded by similar raters.

5.Webpage Display:

The recommended movies for a given user are displayed on a webpage, enhancing the user experience.

## Project Workflow:

1.User Interaction:

The user is prompted to rate a certain number of movies, which will be used to generate personalized recommendations.

2.Recommendation Generation:

Using the provided ratings, the system identifies similar raters and calculates recommendations based on their highly-rated movies.

3.Display of Recommendations:

The recommended movie list is presented to the user, providing valuable suggestions tailored to their preferences.

## Completion Certificate:
A completion certificate for this project can be found [HERE.](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/ZA8D76X2VSE8)
>This certificate validates the successful completion of the "Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals" specialization.
